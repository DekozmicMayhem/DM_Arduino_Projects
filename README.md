# DM_Arduino_Projects

Hello fellow coders!

  I decided to consolidate some scripts for Arduino here to use as a reference for future projects. Anyone is free to use
  this code for their own personal use. I welcome any and all corrections, suggestions, and requests for changes if it is within my 
  time constraints. Keep in mind that I am extremely busy and may not promptly respond. I will consistently check in and update code.
  
  More to follow..........
  
  **Plan of action**
  
   * provide a wiki resource with code references and other useful information.
   * provide detailed, commented code that is reasonably easy to understand.
   * maintain a friendly environment that facilitates learning
